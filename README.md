# MAJOR-PROJECT-K_10
### There is DDOS dataset set which extracted from kaggle which is .arff form and rather converted into the .csv file. This file is generally of 21 lakh Rows which is Huge Dataset.
###### There 29 columns as features of this Dataset
### Here in DDOS_Detect.ipynb is our project progress here we are considering atmost 11-12 features and which are seemed to be important 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
### The Machine Learning ALgorithms which are considered are 
## 1.K- Nearest Neighbor
## 2.Random Forest Classifier
## 3.Naive Bayes
## 4.Support vector machine
#### Here a sample of 6000 cells data was considered instead of working with huge data
#### Almost all of them worked well Gave atmost 82% accuracy
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Here arffcheck.ipynb is an experiment done i.e individual consideration of attack and normal packets in dataset
### there it was done only for HTTP-FLOOD attacked packets and Normal packets jus for reference 
### but the accuracy was given is 99.7% Dono it is a ri8 way to do or not but still it is under process jus go through the arffcheck.ipynb for reference
